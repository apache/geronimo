    <name>Geronimo :: J2EE Application Deployment Specification</name>

    <description>
        This spec is based on the API originally defined by JSR-88.  It is an
        API which tools can use to configure server-specific information for
        a J2EE archive (that is, edit the server-specific deployment descriptors)
        and deploy, undeploy, or redeploy archives to servers (or clusters, etc.).
        It is heavily based on JavaBeans for editing the deployment descriptors.

        This API will be included in J2EE 1.4.  The version on the JSR web site
        is version 1.0, and there's a version 1.1 which corresponds to J2EE 1.4,
        but all you can download right now is 1,0 and a changelog with the
        differences between 1.0 and 1.1.  This Geronimo project defines all the
        classes necessary for v1.1 support.  Elsewhere in Geronimo you can find
        server-side and tool-side implementations of this API.
