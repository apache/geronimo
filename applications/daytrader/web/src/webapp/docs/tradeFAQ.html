<P>The IBM<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Trade Performance Benchmark Sample for WebSphere<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Application Server (otherwise known as Trade 6) provides a suite of IBM-developed workloads
for characterizing performance of  WebSphere Application Server. The
workloads consist of an end-to-end Web application and a full set of Web
primitives. The applications are a collection of Java<SUP>TM</SUP> classes, Java servlets,
Java ServerPages<SUP>TM</SUP> (JSP<SUP>TM</SUP>) files and Enterprise JavaBeans<SUP>TM</SUP> (EJB<SUP>TM</SUP>) built to open Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE<SUP>TM</SUP>) APIs. Together, the Trade application and Web primitives provide versatile and portable test cases that are designed to measure aspects
of scalability and performance.</P><HR>

<P><FONT size="+1" color="#000099"><B>Application Design</B></FONT></P>

<P><B>What is Trade?</B></P>
<P>Trade is an end-to-end Web application that is modeled after an on-line stock brokerage.
Trade leverages J2EE components such as servlets, JSP files, enterprise beans, message-driven beans (MDBs) and Java database connectivity (JDBC<SUP>TM</SUP>) to
provide a set of user services such as login/logout, stock quotes, buy,
sell, account details, and so on through  standards-based HTTP and Web services protocols.</P>

<P><B>What are Web Primitives?</B></P>
<P>The Web primitives leverage the Trade infrastructure to test specific features
of the WebSphere Application Server J2EE 1.4 programming model. A description of each of the Web 
primitives is provided on the <A href="../web_prmtv.html">main web primitive 
page</A>.</P>

<P><B>Why is there a Version 6?</B></P>
<P>The Trade version skipped from Trade 3 directly to Trade 6 in order to match 
the WebSphere Application Server version.  Trade 6 builds on Trade 3 by extending the
programming model from J2EE 1.3 to J2EE 1.4.</P>

<P><B>What is new in Version 6?</B></P>
<P>As previously mentioned, the largest change in Trade 6 has been the conversion
from J2EE 1.3 to J2EE 1.4. This conversion involves updating the deployment descriptors and has
little impact on the actual application code. Other changes in Version 6 include:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>Changes to the Java Messaging Service (JMS) APIs associated with J2EE 1.4</LI>
	<LI>Support for <CODE>DistributedMap</CODE> data caching as well as the ability to configure data caching within Trade from the  <A
		href="../config">Configuration page</A></LI>
	<LI>Configurable iteration count for a number  the Web primitives</LI>
    <LI>Two additional primitives to test JSP-based expression language (EL) support and servlet-based includes</LI>
	<LI>Consolidated installation scripts for single server and cluster configurations</LI>
	<LI>Updated cluster configuration to support changes associated with the embedded messaging provider</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>What changes are made to the cluster configuration?</B></P>
<P>In previous versions of WebSphere Application Server, embedded messaging, based on WebSphere MQSeries<SUP>TM</SUP>, running on a separate node 
defined outside of the Trade cluster handled the JMS portion of 
the Trade workload. In this release, the embedded messaging provider is replaced 
by an in-process, Java-based distributed messaging engine that provides 
workload management, failover, and partitioning capabilities. These 
capabilities provide a wide range of configuration options for messaging. To demonstrate the most common configuration  and to high-light several 
of these capabilities, the following cluster configuration is used for 
Trade 6.
<UL>
    <LI>A messaging engine (ME) is started and mapped to each cluster member.</LI>
    <LI>The entire cluster is added to the Service Integration Bus (SIB), providing failover and workload 
    management capabilities for the MEs.</LI>
    <LI>The TradeBroker queue is localized to the entire cluster, effectively 
    partitioning the queue across the MEs.</LI>
    <LI>Tables are added to the existing Trade database by each ME for 
    internally managing queue and topic messages.</LI>
</UL>
<P>For additional details concerning the configuration of JMS in an ND and cluster 
environment in WebSphere Application Server V6.0, please consult the Information Center.</P>

<P><B>What software is required to run Trade 6?</B></P>
<UL>
    <LI>WebSphere Application Server V6.0</LI>
    <LI>DB2<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Universal Database V8.2, DB2 Universal Database for z/OS Version 8, or Oracle<SUP>&reg;</SUP>  10g database</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>What are the most common configuration scenarios?</B><UL>
    <LI><B><B>Single server with a remote database</B></B> - The Trade application runs on a stand alone WebSphere Application Server instance. The required database software and the associated Trade database are located on a different system from the Application Server. The Application Server system must have the necessary database client software to connect to the remote database. <B></B></LI>
	<LI><B>Single server with a local database</B> - Same as the previous scenario; however, the required database software and the associated Trade database are located on
	the same system as the Application Server.</LI>
	<LI><B>Horizontally clustered servers</B> - In this scenario, a cluster of application servers (one
    server per system) run the Trade application in a  Network Deployment (ND) environment.
    This scenario also requires a remote database.</LI>
</UL>


<HR>
<P><FONT size="+1" color="#000099"><FONT color="#000099"><B>Run-time Configuration</B></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B>What does the ResetTrade link do?</B></P>
<P>The ResetTrade link on the configuration page must be clicked between Trade
runs. This link sets the database to a consistent size by  removing all the newly registered users created during a Trade run. The reset also sets all outstanding orders to a consistent state. Resetting the database to a consistent size ensures repeatable throughput on subsequent Trade runs. </P>

<P><B>How are the Trade configuration parameters modified?</B></P>
<P>The Trade <A HREF="../config">configuration page</A> provides a dynamic mechanism to set
the run-time configuration for a Trade run. These settings control the application
run-time characteristics such as the run-time mode, the
order processing mode, and other run-time variations supported in Trade. All settings are reset to defaults when the Trade application server is restarted.</P>
<P><B>Note:</B> To set configuration parameters when running in a <B></B>cluster<B></B>, access each application server in the cluster on its
internal HTTP port (9080) and configure the  run-time parameters.
Another solution is to use the method for making settings permanent as
described in the following section.</P>

<P><B>Can you make configuration changes permanent?</B></P>
<P>Yes. Normally, Trade configuration parameters return to defaults whenever the Trade application 
server is restarted. Settings can be made permanent by setting the configuration values in the 
servlet init parameters of the TradeApp servlet and the TradeScenario servlet. Modify the 
servlet init parameters in the web.xml file of the Trade Web application to change these parameters.</P>

<P><B>What are the run-time modes?</B></P>
<P>Trade provides two server implementations of the emulated Trade brokerage services.</P>
<UL>
    <LI><B>EJB</B> - Database access uses EJB 2.1 technology to drive transactional trading operations.</LI>
    <LI><B>Direct</B> - This mode uses database and messaging access through direct JDBC and JMS code.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>What are the order processing modes?</B></P>
<P>Trade provides an asynchronous order processing mode through messaging with MDBs. The order 
processing mode determines the mode for completing stock purchase and sell operations. Synchronous 
mode completes the order immediately. Asynchronous mode uses MDB and JMS to queue the order to a TradeBroker agent to complete the order. Asychronous_2-Phase performs a two-phase commit over the EJB 
 database and messaging transactions.</P>
<UL>   
	<LI><B>Synchronous</B> - Orders are completed immediately by the Trade session enterprise bean and entity enterprise beans.</LI>
	<LI><B>Asynchronous 2-phase</B> - Orders are queued to the TradeBrokerMDB for asynchronous processing.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>What are the access modes?</B></P>
<P>Trade provides multiple access modes to the server-side brokerage services.</P>
<UL>
	
	<LI><B>Standard</B> - Servlets access the Trade enterprise beans through the standard RMI protocol</LI>   
	<LI><B>WebServices</B> - Servlets access Trade services through the Web services implementation in 
    WebSphere Application Server. Each trading service is available as a standard Web service through the SOAP Remote Procedure Call (RPC) 
    protocol. Because Trade is wrapped to provide SOAP services, each Trade operation (login, 
    quote, buy, and son on) is available as a SOAP service.</LI>
	
</UL>

<P><B>What are the caching Types?</B></P>
<P>This setting determines which set of dynamic caching technology is used by Trade for data caching. By default, 
data caching is disabled in Trade.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><B>DistributedMap  </B>- This feature is new in WebSphere Application Server V6.0, providing a general API for storing objects
    in the dynamic cache service.</LI>
	<LI><B>Command caching</B> - This caching feature was added to WebSphere Application Server V5.0 for storing command beans in the 
    dynamic cache service. Support for this feature was added in Trade 3 and carried over to Trade 6.</LI>
</UL><P><B>What is the Primitive Iteration setting?</B></P>
<P>By default, the Trade primitives run one operation per Web request. Setting this value alters
the number of operations performed per client request. This is useful for reducing the amount of work
that is performed by the Web Container and for stressing other components within the application server.

<P><B>What is the TradeScenario servlet?</B></P>
<P>The TradeScenario servlet provides a simple mechanism to drive the Trade application.
The Trade database is initially populated with a set of fictitious users
with names ranging from <CODE>uid:0</CODE> to <CODE>uid:499</CODE> and a set of stocks ranging from <CODE>s:0</CODE> to <CODE>s:999</CODE>. The TradeScenario servlet emulates
a population of Web users by generating a specific Trade operation for
a randomly chosen user on each access to the URL. To run the TradeScenario servlet
 use the single <A HREF="../scenario">TradeScenario URL</A> (http://<I>hostname</I>/trade/scenario) with a load generation tool.</P>
<P>Although TradeScenario servlet provides a simple mechanism for driving the Trade application, 
there is a drawback to using this method versus using a series of load generation scripts 
that drive the operations directly. This servlet consumes processing resources on the server
to manage incoming clients and dispatch these simple client requests to complex Trade actions. This
action artificially decreases server throughput because the server is emulating tasks that are normally
 performed by a standard client or a more complex load generation tool.</P>

<P><B>Why does performance decrease over time?</B><P>If Trade runs for an extended time, performance  eventually starts
to decline. This degradation in throughput is a direct result of new users, orders, and holdings
accumulating within the Trade database. As the database grows,  queries take longer
to complete, resulting in higher response times. When the workload is stopped, the 
<A HREF="../config?action=resetTrade">Reset Trade link</A> can be followed to reset the Trade 
run-time by logging off all users, removing new registrations, and other
general cleanup.</P>

<P><B>What is the typical procedure for collecting performance measurements with Trade?</B><P>When Trade is  successfully installed on the application server and the supporting
database is  populated, you can us the Trade application to collect performance measurements.
The following list provides the typical process for gathering performance measurements with Trade.</P>
<OL>
    <LI>Select the  Trade run-time configuration parameters from the <A HREF="../config">configuration page</A> 
    (EJB, synchronous, and son on).</LI>
    <LI>Reset the Trade run-time using the <A HREF="../config?action=resetTrade">Reset Trade link</A>.</LI>
    <LI>Warm-up the application server JVM<SUP>TM</SUP> by applying load for a short period of time. The load generation tool  should access the TradeScenario servlet, 
    web primitives, or use custom scripts to drive the various operations of TradeApp servlet. To warm-up the
     JVM, each code path within Trade must be processed at least 3000 times. Remember that the same code path is not necessarily run on each request unless primitives are being 
    run. Therefore, perform an adequate number of requests to stabilize the 
    performance results.</LI>
    <LI>Stop the load generation tool.</LI>
    <LI>Reset the Trade run-time again</LI>
    <LI>Restart the load generation tool and record measurements after the driver completes the
    requests.</LI>
    <LI>Repeat steps 5 and 6 to obtain additional measurements.</LI>    
</OL>
