# Shutdown script file for Geronimo.
#
# This script calls the geronimo.sh script passing "stop" as the
# first argument followed by the arguments supplied by the caller.
#
# This script is based upon Tomcat's shutdown file to enable
# those familiar with Tomcat to easily stop Geronimo.
# 
# Alternatively you can use the more comprehensive geronimo.sh file 
# directly.
#
# Invocation Syntax:
#
#   shutdown [geronimo stop command args] 
#
#   Invoke the shutdown file without any arguments for information
#   on arguments for the geronimo.sh stop command that is invoked
#   by this script.
#
# Environment Variable Prequisites:
#
#   Refer to the documentation in the geronimo.sh file for information
#   on environment variables etc.
#
