# Startup script file for Geronimo that starts Geronimo in the background.
#
# This script calls the geronimo.sh script passing "start" as the
# first argument followed by the arguments supplied by the caller.
#
# This script is based upon Tomcat's startup file to enable
# those familiar with Tomcat to quickly get started with Geronimo.
# 
# Alternatively you can use the more comprehensive geronimo.sh file 
# directly.
#
# Invocation Syntax:
#
#   startup [geronimo_args ...]
#
# Environment Variable Prequisites:
#
#   Refer to the documentation in the geronimo.sh file for information
#   on environment variables etc.
